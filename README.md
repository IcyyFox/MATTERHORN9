# MATTERHORN9
Thank you for choosing Matterhorn to manage your airline!

This framework was originally built to operate exclusively with AirAlps (A virtual airline which has since shut down). The bot was AirAlps' greatest selling point, and as long as the bot was operational, AirAlps was running the very best in CRP Innovation.

Due to this, many of the code's current values are still set to AirAlps' presets. In order to properly set up the bot for use in your airline, you will need to manually change many of these values. Notably Channel IDs, Names, Images, and the fleet selection. 

DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT A USER-FRIENDLY SETUP.

I am not a wizard, nor do I have the energy anymore to adapt Matterhorn to fully generic and standalone use. Therefore, I advise anyone that is attempting to navigate my shitty code to do so with patience. if you're struggling, remember that Matterhorn's streak system took 4 months before it was fully operational. The bot's core code can be manually modified via /AppData/data.json. Otherwise, the bot can be fully modified via "Bot Maker for Discord" (Available on steam). Please keep in mind that due to the bot's age, compatibility issues may arise with newer builds of BMD.

MATTERHORN 9 (MH9)

MH9 was the final build of Matterhorn.
MH10 was planned, however ultimately never built.
MH10's planned features included:
- Changing nicknames costs SC
- Aircraft trading cards
- Weekly refreshing routes (creates a route between 2 random airports)
- Coloured roles available for SC
- Nobody expects the Spanish inquisition (1:10,000 chance of responding with "No one expects the Spanish inquisition!"
- More manual control over userinfo
- Favourite aircraft tracking

You are free to add or modify any of the features included in this framework!

MH9's AirAlps built included 3 features that are not present in this framework:
- Welcome Message
- Leave Message
- Automatic backups of database files

ANOTHER DISCLAIMER:
- No, I will not host your MH9.
- No, I will not make your MH9 either.
- I can give advice if you have a genuinely good question, but if it takes 3 hours I will give up.
